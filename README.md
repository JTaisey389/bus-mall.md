BusMall Project 

Bus-Mall is an application that allows users to select from specific objects within an array. The products shown are tallied at the end of the excersize and presented on a bar chart to show what the totals are. The webpage aslo saves the data within local storage and the next time someone visits the page it shows the totals from the last person who visted.
